# House-Price-Predictor-ML-Model

In this project, I collected the data "Housing.CSV" which contains all needed house details and trained a model(Random Forest) then deployed it.

## Steps I Used to develop the model.

1. Data Collection: I collected a dataset that contains details about House's price and factors that affect the price.
2. Data Exploration and Preparation: In this step, I cleaned the data by dropping null values and duplicates.  I converted string values to float. I split the data set into input data and output data for training testing and validation.
3. Machine Learning Modelling: In this phase, I developed the Random Forest Model
4. Model Evaluation: To analyze the performance of these models, I used various evaluation metrics such as accuracy & precision.
5. Deployment: I developed the web application 'housing.py' using python and the random forest model then I deployed it using Streamlit.
